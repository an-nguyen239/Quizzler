# Quizzler App
The application where users can have fun with some true/false questions about many different aspects on the world.
Total 13 questions and point will add up after each correct answer.

## How this works
User can easily select the answer whether true/false by click at the button. After 13 questions have passed, users have choice to restart the game to see if they can get the higher point in next trial.
